# Guessing201n

The purpose of this assignment was to create a new branch in GitHub. Create 4 questions that required the user to answer correctly in order to get an alert message. And finally, create a counter that counted the number of correct answers and shared them with the user in the final alert message.

Those tasks have been finished according to my understanding.
